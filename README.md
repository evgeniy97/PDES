# PDES
Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) research by Evgeniy Khomutov and Liliia Ziganurova
**Impotart**
You have to create directory *result* and directories *after_statistics* and *final* in *result*
**Run**  
- Specify config.py file to determinate simulation parameters
- Run *GeneratorQueue.py simulation* to get *script* and run it as './script'
- After simulation *OSW++.cpp* will run *statistic1.py*  from itself
- After all *static1.py* scripts wiil end run *statics2.py* and afret running collect your data in result/final

**TO DO**
- Sorting output file
- Specify output files with more parametrs
- Just get width not to mean it before
